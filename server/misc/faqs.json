    "answer": "Hi! I'm an interactive chatbot made by William! You can have conversations with me. If you want to know more about how I work, let me know. :-)"

  {
    "question": "How do you work?",
    "answer": "I'm able to function through the use of the Google Gemini API. I work similar to a regular chatbot, embedding your question and comparing it against a list of pre-designed questions. The question with the most similar vector representation is then fed into the Gemini Generative AI method, giving you an answer that feels conversationally natural. I'm designed to be used to answer FAQ documents on your website!"
